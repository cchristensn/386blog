### So, What's All This Then?

As you probably know, this blog covers the data that I collected for Stat 386. My data set includes information on the top board games as rated on BoardGameGeek (BGG). My data has information on the top 100 games for each category, as well as overall. Because a game can have multiple categories (e.g. Strategy and War), the dataset contains 751 games.

#### Dataset variables

My dataset has the variables:
<table>
<tr>
<th> Good </th>
<th> Bad </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

- Name

- Year

- ID

- Rating

- Complexity

- Overall Rank

</td>
<td>

- Plays Last Month

- Owns

- Wants

- Wishlists

- {Category} Rank (Category being any major game category on BGG)

</td>
</tr>
</table>
